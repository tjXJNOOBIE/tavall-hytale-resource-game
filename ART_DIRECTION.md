# UI Art Direction

## Purpose
Define the visual direction for CustomUI menus, interactive buttons, selector previews, world interaction prompts, and future packaged UI assets.

The game is a kingdom resource-management experience inside Hytale. UI should feel like a playable kingdom command surface, not a generic web dashboard. Assets should make castle ownership, building upgrades, resources, troops, citizens, and placement actions readable at a glance.

## Recommended Direction: Noble Frontier

Use this as the default direction unless a specific feature calls for a variant.

### Mood
- Practical medieval frontier, not high-fantasy luxury.
- Built from stone, iron, carved wood, cloth banners, wax seals, and resource crates.
- Clean enough for fast reading, but textured enough to feel diegetic.
- UI should feel like a command table used by a castle steward.

### Shape Language
- Panels: squared parchment or dark carved-wood boards with subtle bevels.
- Buttons: compact stone, iron, or wood plates with a small icon socket on the left.
- Primary actions: iron-rimmed blue banners or polished stone buttons.
- Dangerous actions: muted red wax seal or cracked red stone accent.
- Disabled actions: desaturated stone with low-contrast icon and no glow.
- Upgrade/progress controls: horizontal ledger bars, not modern progress pills.
- Placement selectors: translucent blue-white glass volume, thin bright corner rails, and a small red invalid outline.

### Palette
- Parchment: `#d8c394`, `#b99b62`, `#6f5530`
- Charcoal wood: `#2d261f`, `#46392c`, `#6a5136`
- Castle stone: `#8d8a7d`, `#5d5c55`, `#d0cec0`
- Iron: `#4d5960`, `#77858c`, `#c8d0d2`
- Kingdom blue: `#2e5f93`, `#4c8cca`, `#9fd0ff`
- Action green: `#3f7d4a`, `#7fb069`
- Warning red: `#8d3434`, `#c76654`
- Gold accent: `#b88a2f`, `#e0bd63`

### Texture Rules
- Prefer hand-painted voxel-adjacent texture over flat vector art.
- Keep noise subtle; UI text and numbers must remain readable.
- Use edge highlights and corner caps to show click targets.
- Avoid glossy mobile-game gradients, neon sci-fi, or overly ornate fantasy trim.
- Avoid one-color palettes. Every menu should include stone/wood plus one role color.

## Direction Examples

### Example A: Castle Steward Ledger
Best for castle overview, citizens, troop assignments, resources, and economy pages.

- Background: parchment ledger over dark oak frame.
- Header: blue cloth banner with small castle crest.
- Buttons: carved wood plates with iron corner pins.
- Icons: simplified resource stamps, troop helmets, citizen silhouettes, crates, coins, and tools.
- State language: green wax check for available, gold hourglass for in progress, red cracked seal for blocked.
- Asset prompt: `hand-painted medieval kingdom UI ledger, parchment panel in dark oak frame, blue cloth banner header, small readable resource icons, iron corner pins, voxel fantasy game style, clean high-contrast game interface, no text`

### Example B: War Table Controls
Best for placement mode, building selection, castle radius rules, node claims, and command/admin UIs.

- Background: dark wood table with faint grid, map marks, and clipped parchment notes.
- Selector: translucent blue-white box with bright white corners and red invalid ghost outline.
- Buttons: iron plates with engraved placement symbols.
- Icons: hammer, move arrows, rotate, confirm check, cancel X, radius ring, blocked tile.
- State language: blue glow for selected, gold pulse for confirmable, red outline for invalid placement.
- Asset prompt: `voxel fantasy strategy game placement UI, dark wooden war table, translucent blue selection cube, white corner rails, red invalid outline, iron icon buttons, readable high contrast, Hytale inspired, no text`

### Example C: Castle Workshop
Best for per-building upgrade screens, timers, production, cancel controls, and building stats.

- Background: stone workshop panel with wood shelves and small material bins.
- Header: stone nameplate with building icon socket.
- Progress: forge-heated bar or parchment construction timeline.
- Buttons: tool-shaped icon plates for upgrade, cancel, assign, inspect, and collect.
- Icons: hammer/anvil, saw, crate, clock, worker, stone block, food basket, troop banner.
- State language: glowing ember edge for active upgrade, grey ash overlay for unavailable, red cracked tool for cancel.
- Asset prompt: `hand-painted medieval workshop game UI, stone and wood upgrade panel, forge ember progress bar, compact tool icon buttons, resource bins, voxel fantasy aesthetic, readable interface, no text`

## UI Asset Families

### Menu Panels
- `panel_castle_ledger`: parchment center, oak frame, blue banner top.
- `panel_war_table`: dark wood/map surface, strong grid readability.
- `panel_workshop`: stone/wood hybrid with resource-bin detail.
- `panel_node_detail`: rough stone/grass edge with resource vein accent.
- `panel_interior`: warmer candlelit wood and stone, less battlefield contrast.

### Buttons
- `button_primary`: blue banner strip over iron-rimmed stone.
- `button_secondary`: carved wood plate with iron pins.
- `button_confirm`: green wax seal or green-stained stone edge.
- `button_danger`: red wax seal or cracked red stone edge.
- `button_disabled`: grey stone, low saturation, no glow.
- `button_icon_square`: 32x32 or 48x48 icon plate for compact toolbars.

### Icons
- Resources: wood log, stone block, iron ingot, food basket, gold coin, crystal shard.
- Kingdom: castle, banner, crown, population silhouettes, worker hand, troop helmet.
- Buildings: quarry, farm, barracks, workshop, storehouse, watchtower, castle keep.
- Actions: upgrade hammer, assign hand, cancel X, move arrows, rotate, confirm check, inspect eye, timer hourglass.
- Placement: selector cube, radius ring, blocked tile, valid tile, node marker, castle marker.

### Interaction States
- Hover/focus: thin blue-white edge glow.
- Pressed: inset shadow and reduced top highlight.
- Selected: blue cloth tab or glowing corner caps.
- Available: clear icon, normal contrast, subtle edge light.
- In progress: gold hourglass or moving ledger stripe.
- Blocked: red border, cracked seal, desaturated center.
- Cooldown/time left: gold/iron progress bar with small hourglass icon.

## Menu-Specific Direction

### Castle Main
- Use `Castle Steward Ledger`.
- Show a crest, Might, resources, population, and building shortcuts as organized ledger rows.
- Primary actions should use banner-blue buttons.

### Resource Node Detail
- Use `panel_node_detail` with stone/grass/resource vein trim.
- Resource type should control a small accent icon, not the entire palette.
- Assignment buttons should use worker-hand and route icons.

### Building Upgrade UI
- Use `Castle Workshop`.
- Always show level, max level, current stats, next stats, timer/progress, cost, cancel state, and blocked reason when unavailable.
- The action area should reserve stable space so timer text and cancel buttons do not move the layout.

### Placement Selector UI
- Use `War Table Controls`.
- The preview should resemble Hytale-style selection tools: translucent volume, strong corner rails, visible size number, red invalid target outline.
- In-world blocked zones should read clearly around castle radius, node radius, and other protected placements.

### Interior UI
- Use a softer variant of `Castle Steward Ledger`.
- War-table styling should stay outside interiors unless the page is explicitly tactical.
- NPC interaction buttons should feel like small parchment dialogue options attached to the same kingdom UI language.

## Production Rules

- Every icon must work at small sizes first.
- Do not bake text into image assets; CustomUI should own text.
- Keep button states as separate assets or atlas regions.
- Every interactive button needs normal, hover, pressed, and disabled state art so the UI feels responsive without CSS keyframe animation support.
- Runtime button chrome is applied through `HyUiPageMarkupDecorator`; keep element IDs stable and avoid HyUI raw/back/custom button classes for action-bound controls.
- Prefer square power-of-two source assets where practical: 32, 64, 128, 256.
- Use transparent backgrounds for icons and button overlays.
- Use consistent lighting: top-left highlight, bottom-right shadow.
- Keep contrast high enough for resource counts, timers, and blocked placement warnings.
- Assets shipped with the plugin must live under the normal Gradle resource packaging path.
- Generated production assets and the repeatable asset command live in [ASSET_PIPELINE.md](./ASSET_PIPELINE.md).
- Custom alphabet/font reference sheets live in [FONT_TEMPLATES.md](./FONT_TEMPLATES.md).
