# Systems

This repo is split into explicit gameplay and infrastructure systems. `SYSTEMS.md` is the entry map. Each detailed system file owns the verbose notes, cross-system dependencies, runtime behavior, and extension points for that area.

## Current runtime shape
- One Hytale plugin process owns player bootstrap, castle surface gameplay, UI, interior worlds, and economy ticks.
- Castle interiors are separate worlds in the same server process, not separate servers.
- Persistence uses Tavall semantic cache plus Redis/Postgres-backed stores when configured.
- Placement is moving toward interaction-first flows for every world placement feature.
- Bot coverage is split between Java unit tests and remote QUIC scenario runs.

## Main cross-system flows
- Player join: persistence -> session bootstrap -> castle spawn -> castle/node visuals -> clock apply.
- Castle or node interaction: prompt-lane alignment -> focus planner -> interaction service -> UI navigator -> page model -> UI action service.
- Worker anchor interaction: interior anchor ref -> worker NPC interaction service -> citizens/troops UI with worker-specific feedback.
- Placement: command arms placement -> preview markers -> interact or aim-confirm -> placement service -> visuals/persistence refresh.
- Economy tick: planner -> population/resource updates -> node depletion/regeneration -> castle/node visual refresh -> async persist.
- Interior: command/UI -> interior world service -> teleport -> interior visuals/tutorial -> exit back to castle world.

## Current gaps that still matter
- Native world-click bot input is still limited by the shared bot client surface, so placement bots use align -> look -> focus -> interact or aim-confirm instead of direct click packets.
- Placement is now explicit for castles and nodes. Future build stations, castle props, and upgrade pads should be routed through the same placement stack instead of adding one-off commands.
- Placeholder NPC visuals are still doing a lot of explanatory work. The system boundaries are intended to make replacing those with better assets straightforward.
- Castle and node world visuals now prefer simple block markers first and entity/NPC labels second, so a player can read ownership, resources, troops, and Might before opening menus.
